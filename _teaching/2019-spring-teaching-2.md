Lead the computer labs where we explore various biological modeling through computational approach (Matlab), e.g. Lokta-Volterra model, Michaelis Menten Model, Hodgkin-Huxley Model, SIR model, Network, Fractal and etc...

Here is the [syllabus](https://tlin56.github.io/files/150_lab_syllabus_spring_2019.pdf) for the course.

List of labs with description:
======
- Week1: Introduction to Matlab
  - What is Matlab?
  - Basic operations and coding.
  - Writing scripts and functions.
  - Loops.
  - Boolean.
  - Vectorize.
  - Save and load data.
  - ODE45 (maybe).
- Week2: Numerical Methods for solving ODE
  - Examine different types of numerical solvers for ODE and the effect of step size on the error.
- Week3: Eigenvalues
  - Brief explanation of how to find eigenvalues. 
  - Logic of basic methods and characteristic equations and polynomial.
- Week4: Bistability
  - Use Matlab to simulate and analyze dynamical systems that use ODE; use ODE45 to numerically solve; address fixed points and nullclines; also perform sensitivity analysis.
- Week5: Predator-Prey
  - Develop agent-based model for predator-prey dynamics; study how "handling time" arise from individual dynamics.
- Week6: Epidemic outbreaks
  - Model outbreaks using SIR/SIRS model; study the speed, strength and size of outbreaks.
- Week7: Michaelis Menten
  - Michaelis-Menten enzyme-substrate dynamics and the Quasi Steady State Assumption.
- Week8: Hodgkin-Huxley
  - Use Matlab to simulate an excitatory system with the specic case-study of a neuron in mind.
- Week9: Network
  - Use Gephi to study some properties of various networks and methods of how to visualize them.
- Week10: Fractal
  - Learn basic skills you need for analyzing fractals, including box counting method, manipulating images, thresholding, and a bit about regression and model comparison.

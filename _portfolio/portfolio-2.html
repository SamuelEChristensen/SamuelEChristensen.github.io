I took this when I joined a CALeDNA Trip with friendly people from EEB UCLA.This is around UC White Mountain Research Center. We were trying to collect both abiotic and biotic samples for DNA sequencing, which can give us a bit of information about the biodiversity and ecosystem condition there. Cool projects they are doing!

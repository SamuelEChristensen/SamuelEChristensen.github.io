## InFocus: A fast inertial lift calculator in MATLAB

InFocus is an easy-to-use tool that can calculate particle focusing positions in a channel of arbitrary cross section after just a few minutes of computation on a desktop computer.
 The method used draws upon and sharpens asymptotic theory to replace particles by singularities of known sizes.  Read more about the algorithm on The Arxiv.

Hey y’all! I’m Jason Lin, a creative soul living & studying in Los Angeles, CA. Currently I’m a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Biomathematics](https://www.biomath.ucla.edu/) under the [University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu/).

My current academic advisor is [Prof. Van Savage](https://vsavage.faculty.biomath.ucla.edu/).

My research interests are Theoretical Ecology, [Stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_stability), Food Web Dynamics, System Biology, Networks Science, Decision Making, Evolution, information dynamics in biology & signalling.

Currently, I am working with Van Savage on various projects. The main project embarks on exploring the idea that the trophic interaction dimensionality can be one of the significant stressors for the bimodality in size-ratio distributions of ecological communities.

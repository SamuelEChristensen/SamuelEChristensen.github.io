Iâ€™m a 4th year PhD student studying [Biomathematics](https://www.biomath.ucla.edu/) at the University of California, Los Angeles. I received my B.S. in Honors Mathematics and Biophysics in 2017 from the University of Michigan.

My advisor is [Prof. Marcus Roper](https://www.math.ucla.edu/people/ladder/mroper).

My research interests are Fluid Dynamics, Numerical Analysis, Mathematical Biology, Asymptotic Analysis, Microfluidic Devices, and Mathematical Modeling.

I created InFocus, a tool for fast calculation of focusing positions in microfluidic channels.  See my code section for more examples of projects I've coded.

## Calculation of inertial lift for particle in microfluidic channels

Utilizing a combination of asymptotics and numerical methods I created a new way to calculate how particles migrate in microfluidic channels with high Reynolds number without necessitating a solver for complicated structure-fluid interactions with the non-linear Navier-Stokes equations. These calculations are used to predict where particles with move to inside a microfluidic channel.
